# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

* Agent doesn't know his location and orientation. 
* Agent can move with actions 'forward', 'turn left' and 'turn right'. Sometimes he can't handle them correctly. 
* Agent has got a sensor's data about obstacles around him, which contain some errors.
* Every error can appear with certain level of probability. 

## Goals: 
* Write algorithm that calculate probability distribution of agent's location and orientation. 
* Write a heuristic function which allow him to collect the most valuable data.
