# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

* Agent doesn't know his location and orientation. 
* Agent can move with actions 'forward', 'turn left', 'turn right', but he is not handle it correctly every time. 
* Agent has got a sensor's data about obstacles around him, which contain some mistakes.
* Every error can appear with some dose of probability. 

## Goals: 
* Write algorithm that calculate probability distribution of agent's location and orientation. 
* Write an heuristic function which allow him to collect most valuable data.
